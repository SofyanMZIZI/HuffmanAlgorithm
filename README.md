# The Huffman Coding Algorithm

In this project, we implement the Huffman Coding algorithm in c++ fashion .

##Source code

This repository contains the following source code and data files:

* `huffman.cpp` - A C++ programming language implementation.
* `huffman.hpp` - Header File with struct needed in it's own file.

##Usage

To run the algorithm  you can change the text in there for now it's abracadabra sm easter egg ...

    $ g++ huffman.cpp -o huffman
    $ .\huffman

and then run the program:
    Happy Coding :)
